# About This Site

Welcome to my personal blog powered by **Dodge**, a custom static site generator built with Rust!

## About Me

Hi there! I'm a developer passionate about:

- **Systems programming** with Rust
- **Web development** and modern frameworks
- **Open source** software and community
- **Performance optimization** and clean code

## About Dodge SSG

Dodge is my experiment in building a minimal, fast static site generator using the RAM stack:

- **R**ust - For blazing fast performance and memory safety
- **A**ctix - For potential future web server integration  
- **M**arkdown - For simple, readable content authoring

### Why Build Another SSG?

Great question! While there are many excellent static site generators out there, I wanted to:

1. **Learn Rust** by building something practical
2. **Understand** how SSGs work under the hood
3. **Create** something minimal and focused
4. **Have fun** with a side project!

### Features

Current features include:

- ‚úÖ Markdown to HTML conversion
- ‚úÖ Recursive directory processing
- ‚úÖ Clean URL structure
- üöß Template system (coming soon)
- üöß CSS processing (planned)
- üöß RSS feed generation (planned)

## Technology Stack

This site is built with:

- **Generator**: Custom Rust SSG (Dodge)
- **Content**: Markdown files
- **Parsing**: [comrak](https://crates.io/crates/comrak) for CommonMark
- **File handling**: Standard Rust libraries
- **Deployment**: Static file hosting
