# My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on, including the very SSG that powers this site!

## Current Projects

### 🚀 Dodge SSG
*Static Site Generator in Rust*

A minimal, fast static site generator built with Rust. Features include:

- **Fast compilation** using Rust's performance
- **Markdown processing** with CommonMark support
- **Simple configuration** - minimal setup required
- **Extensible design** for future enhancements

**Tech Stack**: Rust, comrak, glob  
**Status**: Active development  
**GitHub**: [View source code](#)

### 🌐 Personal Blog
*This very website!*

My personal blog where I write about Rust, web development, and technology. Built entirely with the Dodge SSG.

**Features**:
- Responsive design
- Fast loading times
- Clean, readable typography
- SEO optimized

**Tech Stack**: Dodge SSG, Markdown, CSS  
**Status**: Live and updated regularly

## Past Projects

### 📊 Data Visualization Tool
*Interactive charts and graphs*

A web-based tool for creating interactive data visualizations. Built to learn modern JavaScript frameworks and data processing.

**Tech Stack**: JavaScript, D3.js, Node.js  
**Status**: Completed

### 🔧 CLI Utility Collection
*Command-line productivity tools*

A collection of small command-line utilities written in Rust to automate common development tasks.

**Tech Stack**: Rust, clap, serde  
**Status**: Maintenance mode

## Learning Projects

### 🦀 Rust Exercises
*Learning Rust through practice*

Working through various Rust programming challenges and exercises to deepen my understanding of the language.

**Resources**:
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
- [Exercism Rust Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust)
- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions

### 🧮 Algorithm Implementations
*Classic algorithms in Rust*

Implementing classic computer science algorithms in Rust to understand both the algorithms and Rust's approach to systems programming.

**Completed**:
- Sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort)
- Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra)
- Data structures (linked lists, trees, hash tables)

## Future Ideas

Things I'd like to build:

- 🔍 **Search engine** for static sites
- 📱 **Mobile app** using Rust and WebAssembly
- 🎮 **Game engine** exploration project
- 🤖 **CLI tool** for developer productivity

## Open Source Contributions

I believe in giving back to the open source community. Some areas where I contribute:

- **Documentation improvements** for Rust crates
- **Bug fixes** in tools I use regularly
- **Feature requests** and testing for new releases
